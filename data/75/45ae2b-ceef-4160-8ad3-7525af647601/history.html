    <h1>The History of Gnus</h1>

    <p>Gnus was <a href="2.0/">originally written</a> by Masanobu
      UMEDA in 1988, I believe, and went through a series of releases
      up until 1992.

    <p>I started a rewrite of GNUS in late '94. The most important
      thing about a rewrite is to find a neat name. «Warp GNUS NT: TNG
      Six.0 for Windows» was my first attempt, but someone suggested
      «(ding)», so I went with that instead, until we decided that
      «Gnus» is really a perfectly good name.  So we went back to that
      one, but without caps.

    <p>Having gotten the difficult part over with, I set out to
      change GNUS into what I wanted it to be: fast, flexible and
      tidy.  At the same time, I really liked GNUS, so I didn't want
      to change the user interface much, except to make it more
      straightforward.

    <p>Gnus is supposed to work as a drop-in replacement of
      GNUS. Casual users shouldn't notice anything much - Gnus
      understands GNUS startup files and variables.  Most functions
      have kept their names.  Almost all key-bindings are the same.
      However, internal structures have been completely redone, so if
      you have written clever functions that rely on anything but the
      most top-level commands, your code will fail.

    <p>The first "proper" release of Gnus 5 was done in November
      1995 when it was included in the Emacs 19.30 distribution (132
      (ding) Gnus releases plus 15 Gnus 5.0 releases).

    <p>In May 1996 the next Gnus generation (aka. "September Gnus"
      (after 99 releases)) was released under the name "Gnus 5.2" (40
      releases).

    <p>On July 28th 1996 work on Red Gnus was begun, and it was
      released on January 25th 1997 (after 84 releases) as "Gnus 5.4".

    <p>Quassia Gnus was the next release.

      So if you're feeling queer or queasy<br>
      You just quaff a<br>
      cup of quassia<br>
      very quickly<br>
      from a quaigh
    </div>
    
    <p>From <em>The Puffin Joke Book</em>.

    <p>
      It was released as Gnus 5.6.

    <p>Then came Pterodactyl Gnus, which has now
      been released as Gnus 5.8/5.9.

    <p>Oort Gnus was started in October 2000.  It's big, it's way out
    there, and it occasionally rains down death and destruction on
    innocent bystanders.  

    <p>Oort Gnus was released as Gnus 5.10 in May 2003 - and Gnus 5.11
    bundled with GNU Emacs 22.1 in June 2007.

    <p>Work on the following development version, dubbed No Gnus, was
    begun in January 2004. A version of No Gnus was released as Gnus
    5.13 with GNU Emacs 23.1 in July 2009.
